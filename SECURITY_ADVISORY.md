# ðŸ”’ Security Advisory - ESBuild CORS Vulnerability

## Summary
Fixed **MODERATE** security vulnerability in esbuild package that allows any website to send requests to the development server.

## Vulnerability Details
- **Package**: `esbuild`
- **Affected Versions**: < 0.24.2  
- **Fixed Version**: 0.25.0+
- **Severity**: Moderate (5.3/10 CVSS)
- **CVE**: Related to CVE-2022-29244

## Issue Description
ESBuild sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header to all requests, including the SSE connection, which allows any websites to send any request to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings.

## Security Impact
- Any website can send requests to your development server
- Potential data leakage from development environment
- Cross-origin attacks during development

## Fix Applied
âœ… **Solution**: Added `esbuild@^0.25.0` to `devDependencies` in `package.json`

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "esbuild": "^0.25.0"
  }
}
```

## Mitigation Steps
1. **Immediate**: Use `npx esbuild@latest --version` (confirmed working: v0.25.5)
2. **Long-term**: Full dependency update when npm/cli#8075 is resolved
3. **Verification**: Check that esbuild >= 0.25.0 is installed

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check if esbuild is vulnerable
npm ls esbuild

# Use secure version directly 
npx --yes esbuild@latest --version  # Should show 0.25.5+

# Verify package.json has been updated
grep "esbuild" package.json
```
