- Make MULTIPLE SMALL commits vs. one large commit

### Quality Standards
- Write PRODUCTION-READY code from first commit
- Prioritize SIMPLICITY over complexity
- Use EXISTING PATTERNS from codebase
- Follow TYPESCRIPT STRICT mode requirements
```

**Quality Gate Integration:**
- TypeScript compilation: `pnpm run type-check`
- Linting validation: `pnpm run lint`
- Test coverage: `pnpm run test`
- Security scanning: `./tools/codacy-runtime.sh`

### 3. AI Prompt Optimization

**Template-Based Development:**
- **Component prompts** with accessibility and testing requirements
- **API prompts** with security and validation patterns
- **Page prompts** with SEO and performance optimization
- **Quality checklists** for consistent delivery
