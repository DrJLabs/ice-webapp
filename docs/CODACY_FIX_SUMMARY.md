# Codacy CLI Integration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Global MCP Configuration Missing Environment Variables**
   - Added CODACY_CLI_PATH to the global ~/.cursor/mcp.json
   - Added PATH with tools directory to ensure CLI is found

2. **Node.js Version Mismatch**
   - Updated package.json engines field to support Node.js v20.19.1 instead of requiring v22.0.0+

3. **Environment Script Command Correction**
   - Fixed the CLI command in tools/codacy-env.sh to use `version` instead of `--version`

4. **Comprehensive MCP Server Setup**
   - Ensured both global and project MCP configurations were properly set up
   - Fixed file paths and environment variables in both configurations

## Verification Results

All verification steps now pass:
- ✅ Codacy CLI binary exists and is executable
- ✅ Global MCP config has proper Codacy server configuration
- ✅ Project MCP config has proper Codacy server configuration
- ✅ All necessary symlinks are in place
- ✅ CLI executes successfully

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Integration**
   - Restart Cursor IDE completely for changes to take effect
   - The MCP server should now properly detect and use the Codacy CLI

2. **When Adding New Dependencies**
   - Remember to run the Codacy analysis with Trivy tool
   - Fix any security vulnerabilities before continuing

3. **After File Edits**
   - The Codacy CLI will automatically analyze edited files
   - Fix any issues reported by the analysis tools

## Maintenance

If you encounter issues in the future:
1. Run `node tools/verify-codacy-cli.js` to check the setup
2. If needed, run `node tools/codacy-mcp-fix.js` to fix configuration issues
3. Source the environment script: `source tools/codacy-env.sh`
